When I was editing and looking at the code to make sure that everything was done correctly, one of the first things that I did this time that I never did any other time I did the projects, was take the project phase by phase and have the AI engine explain to me all the things that needed for the project. This really helped me break down all the things that I need to add into the AI prompt to make sure all of key characteristics are included.

After writing and submitting the prompts, I made sure to include the pseudocode to make sure that the variables that are in there, are the variables that the AI engine puts into the code that is being generated. I also made sure to include in the prompt the opportunity to use the swap() method whenever necessary. One of the things that I really loved about using the AI was when I did not understand why they were adding certain things (I noted this in my interaction log).

We were warned in the README that the AI does not import collections much of the time, so when I prompt the AI, I do so in the different sections. Like for this project, I did each of the sorting methods individually to make sure that when the imports are needed, I can make sure they are done and I don't forget (cause I tend to do that). I know I had to add all the imports for everything except for when generating the test class, since that is the only class that was completely generated using the AI.

When it came to editing the test class, I noticed there was an error with one of the test methods. The AI generated two methods that had the same name, so I made sure that all the errors were gone, and all the tests were able to run successfully.
